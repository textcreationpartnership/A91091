            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>PROPOSALS, SHEWING</hi> How a <hi>Duty</hi> on<hi>SUGARS,</hi> Imposed by an Act Expiring in <hi>June</hi> next, may be Continued, and made no Burthen to the Plantations.</head>
            <p>IF the Act Imposing a Duty on Sugars goes off the Twenty fourth of <hi>June</hi> next, which unless revived this Session it will, a considerable Part of the Revenue will fall off; and since the Cause of it proceeds from a tender Regard to the Plantations; It's Humbly Proposed,</p>
            <p>That the two Shillings four Pence <hi>per Cent.</hi> Impost Duty, on Muscovado or Brown Sugars, be permitted to go off only.</p>
            <p>By the Remove of this two Shillings four Pence Duty, all the Plantations who Import Muscovado Sugars, will be eased, and they are <hi>Jamaica, Nevis, Antego, Monserat, St. Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> and <hi>Berbadoes,</hi> these being all the Sugar Islands we have, and who Import Muscovado Sugars only, being the first Product, <hi>Barbadoes</hi> only excepted, who Import about a fourth part of the Sugar of that one Island Purged or Clayed.</p>
            <p>This Ease being given to our Plantations where the Duty is only a Burthen, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Buyer hereby deprived of 2 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> Draw-back, which hath been a very great Motive to them to Export Muscovado Sugars on Forreign Bottoms to be Manufactured out of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Duty on all White Sugar, and Sugar fit for use, continued as now it stands, will Preserve a Revenue to the King, and not lessen the quantities of Clayed Sugars imported: For, as it always hath been at the Choice of the Clayers whether they Import their Sugars in Muscovado or Clayed, yet have they hitherto Imported Clayed, notwithstanding this Duty was upon it.</p>
            <p>But it may be Objected,<lb/> That the Duty of two Shillings four Pence being removed, and this Duty continued, will Induce them to Import their Sugars in Muscovado: It is Answered,</p>
            <p>This were to be Wished rather than its Hoped, for the Plantations and the Kingdom in its Trade and Navigation would fare the Better for it.</p>
            <p>But if it can be supposed that the Quantity of Clayed Sugars in its Importations will be hereby abated, the Revenue will suffer little by it, since the Imports of Muscovado Sugars in its Quantitities will be so Augmented thereby, that the lesser Duty on that will amount to near, if not altogether as much as the greater on the Clayed.</p>
            <p>But if the Act Expires the Twenty Fourth of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>une</hi> next, and goes entirely off, The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and Third sorts of Clayed (termed) Sugars, fit for Use, and which many times sells for double the Price of Muscovado, will be Imported at the same Duty as Muscovado: No Notice being taken of those sorts in the Book of Rates, there being none Imported when it was made.</p>
            <p>This will put the Clayer upon Importing those sorts only, avoiding thereby the Duty of White, which is Five Shillings, by making them a little Inferiour, and so the King will have but one Duty upon all sorts of Sugars, Claying of Sugar greatly lessening the Quantities, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb facs="tcp:171825:2"/>the Duty; and which is a greater Mischief, the <hi>Navigation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Gentlemen Interested in Claying of Sugars are but few in Number, tho' a fourth part of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> in their Hands, and have great Estates, some of them not so little as three Thousand Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> all Charges paid; and it seems Just and Equal they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Duty (Contentedly) towards the Charge of the War, since this War is made much more Expensive, by Maintaining many Men of War, Winter and Summer, to Protect and Preserve their great Estates, as well as the rest of the Islands.</p>
            <p>It will look very severe that the Nation should be Taxed to supply this Revenue going off, when these Gentlemen in a very Profitable Trade shall be Excused, being so well able that there are but very few Claying Planters in <hi>Barbadoes</hi> but keep their Coaches, and very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny keep Coaches and six Horses, and live in as great Splendor, and have as great Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Livery, as many Noble Men in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This is not mentioned from any Envy to their Greatness, may they be as Great as their Hearts can desire, so it be not to make the Interest of the Nation in its Trade, Navigation and Plantations, <hi>very little and poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it is of absolute Necessity that a Physitian must know where the Diseased Part lyes e're he can adapt a Remedy, so in this Political Body or Interest it's necessary to Point to the aggriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Part and the sound also, least the Remedy be misapplyed. To Conclude, the Muscovado Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters stand in the Interest of the Nation, and with submission ought to be Preserved and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, and they cannot be better Provided for than by Encouraging the Refining of Sugars in the Kingdom, for thereby are their Buyers multiplyed, and that makes a good Market for them; and without this it would be very hard that they should be enjoyned, as by the Act of Navigation they are, to bring their Sugars to <hi>England,</hi> and yet to have no Demand there for them, but what the Forreign Buyer makes for Exportation.</p>
